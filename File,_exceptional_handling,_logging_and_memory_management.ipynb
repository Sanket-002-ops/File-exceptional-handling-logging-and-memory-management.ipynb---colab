You can filter logs based on severity, making it easier to find important information.\n",

Python's garbage collector detects and removes such cycles, ensuring that memory is freed even in these cases.\n",

        "Closing a file in Python is crucial for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Resource Management:**  Files are system resources.  Keeping files open unnecessarily consumes system resources (like file descriptors), which can eventually lead to resource exhaustion if many files are left open.  Closing files releases these resources back to the operating system, making them available for other processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Integrity:**  When you write data to a file, it's often buffered in memory before being physically written to disk.  Closing a file ensures that any buffered data is flushed to disk, guaranteeing that all the data you intended to write is actually written to the file. If you don't close the file and your program crashes, the buffered data may be lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Preventing Corruption:** Leaving files open, especially for writing, increases the risk of file corruption if the program terminates unexpectedly.  Proper closing flushes data and finalizes the file, minimizing this risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Portability:**  Properly closing files improves the portability of your code. Some operating systems have limits on the number of open files a process can have, and failure to close files may lead to errors or unexpected behavior on those systems."
